Following are notes useful for releasing Numexpr.

Preliminaries
-------------

- Make sure that ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` and ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` are up to
  date with the latest news in the release.

- Check that ``release=True`` in ``numexpr/version.py``.

- Do a commit and a push:

  $ git commit -a -m"Getting ready for release X.Y.Z"
  $ git push

Testing
-------

- Run the test suite in different platforms (at least Linux and
  Windows) and make sure that all tests passes.

- Re-compile with MKL support and see if all tests passes as well.

- Run all the benchmarks in ``bench/`` directory and see if the
  speed-ups are the expected ones.

Packaging
---------

- Make the tarball with the command:

  $ python setup.py sdist

  Do a quick check that the tarball is sane.

- Make the binary packages for supported Python versions (2.6 and 2.7
  currently).  Check that installer works correctly.

Uploading
---------

- Go to the downloads section of the Numexpr project in Google Code
  and upload the source tarball and the binary packages.

- Upload it also in the PyPi repository:

  $ python setup.py sdist upload
  $ python setup.py register

Announcing
----------

- Update the release notes in the numexpr site:

  https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/wiki/Release-Notes

- Send an announcement to the NumPy list and python-announce list.
  Use the ``ANNOUNCE.rst`` file as skeleton (or possibly as the
  definitive version).


Post-release actions
--------------------

- Create a tag ``X.Y.Z`` from ``master``.  Use the next message:

  $ git tag -a X.Y.Z -m "Tagging version X.Y.Z"

- Push the tag to the github repo:

  $ git push --tags

- Edit ``numexpr/version.py`` to add the patch-level
  revision (i.e. X.Y --> X.Y.1).  Set the `release` variable to False.

- Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt``
  and empty the release-specific information in ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` and
  add this place-holder instead:

  #XXX version-specific blurb XXX#


That's all folks!
